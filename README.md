This implementations uses a genetic algorithm to find the shortest route
between cities.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/vascoferreira25/travelling_salesman_problem_rust
```

## Purpose

Find the best possible route for a list of cities.
The cities are represented in the following chart:

![cities_map](./docs/cities_map.png "Map with the cities")

## Results

Run the simulation with `cargo run --release` and see how fast it gets the best
result.

The best result (so far) is: `565.685424949238`.
